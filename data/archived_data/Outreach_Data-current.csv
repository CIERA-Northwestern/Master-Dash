What is your favorite thing that you learned from this program?... ‚ÄúLearning about how scientists discover planets and some of their characteristics using light. I have never heard this information and it was especially surprising to know that I could figure out what a planet‚Äôs composition is using the colors of light.‚Äù
‚ÄúDuring the 2 weeks of my participation in this program, I was able to learn more about what goes on inside a lab, whether that be proper use of lab equipment or getting a better sense of what it feels like to work with a group researching. Another interesting thing that I learned was about astronomy with CIERA and the process that goes into discovering new solar systems or other stars. Overall, I learned more about STEM related careers and skills for the future!‚Äù
‚ÄúWorking with a team on STEM related activities gave me a sense of belonging to the science community and helped me stay motivated in working towards my career. I wasn‚Äôt sure what else I could do in STEM besides engineering or being a doctor, but this program helped me explore the diverse careers that STEM offers and reassure me that I want to continue to pursue it in college.‚Äù
‚ÄúI liked learning about space and planets. I also liked that we made a cool discovery and did labs.‚Äù
